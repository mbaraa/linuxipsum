          What you guys are referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as
          I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an
          operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a
          fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell
          utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined
          by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system
          every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events,
          the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called "Linux",
          and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU
          system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and
          these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they
          use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the
          machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is
          an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it
          can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux
          is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the
          whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the
          so-called "Linux" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.
